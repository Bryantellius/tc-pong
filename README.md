# Features

1. Scoreboard
   - Users will be able to select players, and progress through a game until the game is over, then the scores/records will be updated for each player in the league/lists
2. Rankings
   - Users will play exhibition matches
   - Power Rankings will consist of top 20 players based on wins/ranked wins
   - Starting out, power rankings will be adjusted manually by user/admin review
     - Eventually this feature will be automated based on more user data

## Brainstorm

- How to determine rankings?
  - With a small number of starting users, most users will be 'ranked'. This means that every exhibition match will be against a ranked opponent.
- Minimum ranking data points:
  1. Number of games
  2. Number of games against ranked opponents (includes both wins and losses)
  3. Margin of victory (only versus ranked opponents)

## Definitions

### Match

- A match consists of games of first to 11, win by 2. Each match typically lasts best of 5 (win 3 games to win the match)
- Given time restraints, best of 3 is permitted

### Other general rules

- All rules are inherited from ITTF competition rules
- The basics:
  1. Serve tosses must rise 6 inches before being struck
  2. Serves must be struck behind the table end line
  3. Each player serves for 2 consecutive serves, then the opponent with serve 2 until the game concludes or reaches deuce
  4. During a deuce, the rotation of serves changes from every 2, to every other until the conclusion of the match (an opponent reaches a gap margin of 2)
  5. Serve the hit the net result in a 'let'. Two consecutive lets results in a fault.
  6. Faults are lost points for the server, where a server fails to land the server on the opponent's table side
  7. During Rallies, players are not permitted to touch their hand to the table
  8. Etc...
